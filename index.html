	<h1>❤To Jane❤</h1>
	<p class="p1">
		This is too complicated for me. I don't know where to start.<br>
		But somethings need to be get rid off the way immediately<br>
		Why is this too difficult for me to do. Let me stop beating<br>
		around the bush and get straight to the point<br>
	</p>

	<p class="p2">
		Firstly I LOVE YOU!, I don't know if love is an appropriate<br>
		word to use but that's how I feel towards you. I've been<br>
		trying my level best to ignore my feelings for you but the<br>
		more or the longer I try to ingore them the stronger and<br>
		faster my love for you grows. My heart is overflowing with<br>
		the love I have for you. I even regret ingoring this, now<br>
		I'm overwhelmed by the love I have for you. To be honest<br>
		if I kept trying ignore this I was going to be killed by<br>
		this excessive love.<br>
	</p>

	<p class="p3">
		I don't easily fall in love with girls no matter how<br>
		beautiful they can be. But when I see you I see someone<br>
		special, someone who I want to spend time with. I see a<br>
		very beafutiful soul. I know that you're very beautiful,<br>
		in fact I could spend the whole day if I try to describe<br>
		your beaufty. What attracted me to you is the your innerself<br>
		I just feel happy when I see you.
	</p>
